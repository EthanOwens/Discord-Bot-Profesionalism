Developed in Python 3.9.6

This project was made for my Professionalism in Computer Science Course

This project creates a simple Discord bot to award and track experience points to users when they send chat messages. All data for this project is stored in an SQLite3 database.

NOTE: The authorization token in .env is not up to date for security's sake.
